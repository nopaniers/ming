# Ming Operating System

This is an attempt to write a phone operating system for ARM based
phones. The aims of this project are:

1) *Security*. Defence in depth.
2) *Beauty*. Maintainable.
3) *Easy to develop and develop for*.

At the moment I'm considering some non-standard options, like

- Developing in Rust, because it has a nice syntax (2) and memory model which might protect us (1).
- Having the user interface based on HTML (3).
 
I doubt this will go far, it's just for fun. 

Ming is named after my beautiful wife.
