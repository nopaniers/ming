# Ming Operating System

This is an attempt to write a phone operating system for ARM based
phones. The aims of this project are:

1. *Security*. Defence in depth.
2. *Beauty*. Maintainable.
3. *Easy*. Ultimately easy to write to apps.

At the moment I'm considering some non-standard options, like
developing in Rust, because it has a nice syntax and memory model
which might protect us, having the user interface based on HTML, and
incorporating Bitcoin. These are a distant dream though.

This is just for fun. 

Ming is named after my beautiful wife.
