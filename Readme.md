# Ming Operating System

This is an attempt to write a phone operating system for ARM based
phones. The aims of this project are:

1. *Security*. Defence in depth.
2. *Beauty*. Readable, maintainable.
3. *Easy*. Easy to use.

I'm considering having the user interface based on HTML, and
incorporating Bitcoin to natively do finance. These are a distant
dream though.

This project is just for fun.

Ming is named after my beautiful wife.
